# Global trends in expression figure generation

`expression_ANOVA.R` contains the plotting commands to generate the plots associated with Figure 2A and Figure 2B. 

*The following data files are required for generation of these plots:*

-	`PVE_regressions.csv` for generation of Figure 2A
-	`contGroup_variance.csv` for generation of Figure 2B

Both of these data files are distributed via the `global_expression_trends` directory in the [MAGE zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/10535719)
