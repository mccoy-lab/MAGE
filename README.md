# MAGE: a resource for Multi-ancestry Analysis of Gene Expression

MAGE comprises RNA-seq data from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 731 individuals from the [1000 Genomes Project (1KGP)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15393), representing 26 globally-distributed populations across five continental groups. These data offer a large, geographically diverse, open access resource to facilitate studies of the distribution, genetic underpinnings, and evolution of variation in human transcriptomes and include data from several ancestry groups that were poorly represented in previous studies.

## Data Access

### Raw reads:
Newly generated RNA sequencing data for the 731 individuals (779 total libraries) is available on the Sequence Read Archive (Accession: [PRJNA851328]()).

### Processed data
Processed gene expression matrices and QTL mapping results are currently available on Dropbox: <img src="/images/dropbox.png" width="15" style="float: bottom;"> **[MAGEv.01 Data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/x37i95777zm0l0db1ngh0/h?rlkey=lpl5n6e82gh7tctr588m9vort&dl=0)**

These data are described in detail in this repo, in the [data](/data) directory.

### Variant calls

The high-coverage variant calls used for QTL mapping were previously generated by the [New York Genome Center (NYGC)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.004) and are available through the 1KGP [FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20201028_3202_phased/).
